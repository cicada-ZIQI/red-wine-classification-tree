# red-wine-classification-tree
This is a machine learning project. I need to use the train data to grow a classification tree and use this tree to predict the quality of the red wine using the test dataset. I use CART algorithsm to grow tree and CCP, PEP and PEP method to prune the tree repectively. Finally the prediction accuracy  is at most 90.02% by using CCP to prune.
